# Deliciousness
Deliciousness is the go-to website for users looking for a wide range of easily accessible recipes. The project intends to plan, design, and create a cooking recipe web-based system that stores cooking recipes posted by users.

The webpage will show recipe instructions for users to follow and use throughout their everyday life. Overall, this site is designed to view, share, and manage recipes.
